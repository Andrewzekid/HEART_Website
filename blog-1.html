    <p class="py-8 w-3/4 text-base font-light">The book drive is one of our latest fundraising projects. With this we plan to collect story books at our school to sell them to a second-hand bookstore called Book-Off. With the revenue we will receive from Book-Off we plan to buy stationary items that will help assist Syrian Refugees. 

      We go this wonderful project idea, with the help Of Rina Salameh, a half Japanese and half Syrian students studying at Kaichi Nihonbashi Gakuen. In 2018, she conducted a stationary drive and collected hundreds of pens and pencil to donate to a Syrian Elementary school. She in fact went personally to the Syrian elementary school and donated ALL the kind donations from the students and teachers alike at her school in Japan - Kaichi Nihonbashi Gauken. This year with the same goal in mind, Ms. Rina is planning to have a bigger donation drive! And we the members of HEART have decided to assist her as much as possible in this journey. 
      
      To do so, as mentioned above we will collect story books from students, parents, and teachers at K. International School Tokyo. The books can be anything ranging from English story books to Japanese Non-Fiction books. Any book in decent condition is great! The only thing necessary is your intention of helping the students and the future leaders in Syria! </p>
