        On November 23rd, we would like to open a charity stall to raise funds for the refugees and to spread awareness about the refugee crisis that is happening in the world today. 
        We would like to open a booth in the basketball court area, to sell items such as Coffee, Tea, Snack Packs, and Cards. The purpose of this charity stall is to accumulate funds to donate to REI (Refugee Empowerment International).
         Information about this organization is described below. We are planning to donate the funds we raised in this stall to the Refugee Empowerment International (REI) organization.
          They are an organization which take actions and spread awareness about refugees in Japan through Manga’s and animations. Here is the link to their website: <a href="https://rei-npo.org/en/" class="underline text-blue-600">https://rei-npo.org/en/</a>  We have had several meetings with the Executive Director Ms. Best, and we are currently collaborating with them by creating manga and videos using the stories they have gotten first-hand from the refugees. Because October 23rd is Parents Explanation Day, we expect many parents (and even their kids) to visit KIST. This creates the opportunity to spread awareness about refugees to more people, especially outside the school community. On the kiosk desk, we will place informative pamphlets created by REI and Manga’s we have made from the refugees’ stories. We hope that this will further inform people about the purpose of our organization and encourage them to purchase our products/donate. </p>
